// pair (AUTH_USERNAME/AUTH_PASSWORD) this app used to gate every route
// with — see docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md for why that changed. There are still
// no permission levels: any logged-in account can do everything, exactly
// like the old shared password could; this only makes it possible to tell
// who did what (ExpenseRecord.createdByName/updatedByName) and to revoke
// one person's access without changing everyone else's.

// Named/filed as `proxy.ts` (not `middleware.ts`) — this Next.js version
// (16) renamed the convention; see node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/
// 03-api-reference/03-file-conventions/proxy.md. The exported function
// must be named `proxy`, not `middleware`. Also as of v16, Proxy defaults
// to the Node.js runtime (not Edge) — see that same doc's "Runtime"
// section — which is why lib/auth.ts can use node:crypto directly.
